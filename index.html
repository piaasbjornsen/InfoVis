            According to EU law, terrorist offences are acts committed with the aim of:

            seriously intimidating a population
            unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act
            seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social

            Terrorism involves crimes committed for ideological motives. Terrorists focus on preparing
            or committing serious acts of violence. Typically, these acts aim to disrupt society with the
            goal of bringing about societal changes, instilling serious fear in the population, or
            influencing political decision-making. Terrorism and online hate speech manifest in various
            forms on the internet. Radical and terrorist expressions can be made online, including texts
            and videos that call for acts of violence.

    In the below graph you can see the number of casualties, which is the combination of deaths and injuries occured by a terrorist attack for the last 30 years. We can see 
    that there is an overall increase in the average number of casualties from 1970 to 2020. This can potentially be explained by two main reasons.
    First, advancements in technology and especially advancements in military technologies may have played an important role in amplifying the overall toll of casualties during this multi-decade period.
    Secondly, the escalating geopolitical conflicts and increased intensity of armed conflicts in several parts of the world have collectivelly contributed to this rise.</p>

          2015.Multiple locations across the city were targeted by gunmen and suicide bombers, resulting in a tragic
          loss of life and leaving many others injured. The attackers targeted a concert hall, a soccer stadium, and
          several restaurants and bars.The "Attentats du 13-Novembre" had a profound impact on France and the
          international community, prompting heightened security measures and a collective response against terrorism.

      <p style="color: black; font-size: 1vw; padding-top: 3vh; padding-left: 10vh; padding-right: 10vh;">
      In terms of global mortality, terrorism is relatively uncommon compared to other causes of death as we can see in the graph. Most people are more
      likely to die from non-violent causes like diseases or accidents. It is though important to mention that terrorism's impact is amplified due to its
      international nature and the fear it generates globally.  </p>

      <p style="color: black; font-size: 1vw; padding-top: 3vh; padding-left: 10vh; padding-right: 10vh;">
        Certain regions experience a higher frequency of terrorism compared to others, often due to a combination of geopolitical, socio-economic, and historical factors.
      As we can see the Middle East appears to have a bigger number of terrorist attacks, which can be justified from several reasons. Some phenomena that we meet in the Middle East play a contributing factor in the appearence of terrorism
    such as political instability, historical conflicts and authoritarian government. We also detect high terrorism frequency in India and Pakistan since threre is ongoing conflict both religious as well as geopolitical for the Kashmir conflict
    where the Kashmir region is claimed by both India and Pakistan and has created several attacks. As we can see in the US there have been as well several terrorist attacks throughout history. Political extrimism has been associated with terrorism from both left and right parties.
    Furthemore, religious extremism mostly from islamic religion has lead to terrorist attacks like the 9/11. Another contributing factor is the high accessibility in weapons in US that is a highly contibuting factor to terorist attacks like mass shootings or school shootings.     </p>

      <p style="color: black; font-size: 1vw; padding-top: 3vh; padding-left: 10vh; padding-right: 10vh;">
        In the graph below we examine further which specific countries are affected the most from terrorism. As we can see in the graph the country with the highest number of attacks is Iraq. 
      Several factors have contributed to this hightened level of terrrorism, such as the US invasion in Iraq at 2003 which lead to government breakdown and gave space to the rise of terrorist groups.
    Furthemore, Iraq is an especially diverse population with various of ethnic and sectarian groups like Arabs, Kurds and differend sects of Islam which creates tensions and conflicts among these groups.
    Weak govenrment and corruption in combination with decades of conflict and civil wars are the main reasons for Afghanistan as well to be in the second position for highest number of attacks. Additionally, the Taliban 
    group in the framework of the insurgency agaist the Afghan government employed several terrorism actions to achieve this. In the map graph we mentioned the Pakistan an India conflicts which has led to several occurancies 
    and this is confirmed in this circular plot as well. The rest of the top 10 countries in the graph they have this ranking due to similar reasons which mostly involve insurgencies, weak government and ethnic and religious tensions.   </p>

        This diagram will help you further understand the patterns and differences between the attacks in the top 10 countries that suffer from them worldwide. 
      In the left side you can see the different terrorist groups that have employed terrorist attacks or still are. For every group we can follow the lines to see the number of terrorist attacks performed each year
    from 2011 to 2021 to each one of the most affected countries. It is worth mentioning that the biggest number of attacks' responsible group are classified as
    uknown. This facts is very reasonable since most of the terrorist groups' goal is to act in secret and avoid detection by law and security, and this coupled with the advancements in communication and technology, allows 
  many terrorist groups to maintain a level of anonymity and several attacks to remain as 'uknown' reason. </p>
